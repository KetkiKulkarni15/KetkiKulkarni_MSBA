Hi, I am Ketki Kulkarni, a student at the University of Utah. I am pursuing my master's degree in Business Analytics. 
This is my first assignment for IS 6812-001. 


In this assignment - 
1. I created my GitHub profile. 
2. Created a new repository and added new files to it.
3. Committed changes made to the file.
4. Made a few changes in the files and checked the history of those changes.
